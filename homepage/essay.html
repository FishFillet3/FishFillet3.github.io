        <h1>“Hello, Sir!” The Art of the PTKD Center</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>On the outside, the Professional Martial Arts Taekwondo Center fits itself right in between a grocery store and a restaurant; you may not even notice it. However, if you take a closer look, you can see right through the double door, which is mostly made of hard glass with a black frame. You may stop by for a moment to look through it and watch as we are either warming up or doing our exercises or maybe even learning a new combination of blocks and kicks. Some stay to watch for a while while others take a quick glance and continue where they were going to. Few actually decide to start taking the classes themselves. While you’re watching, you may not even notice that one of the walls is mostly a huge mirror, while we stare at our reflection in it when practicing something. You may not notice that the floor is actually made of wood colored foam tiles with those specially shaped edges to interlock with each other, which I am very thankful for since it would otherwise make falls a lot more painful. You may not notice the targets that are hooked on the wall opposite to the mirror, while we run to that wall and back to get those targets every time we’re paired up. You may not notice the door all the way in the back that leads to a small office, which I don’t notice very often either and sometimes forget it even exists until someone opens it. You probably won’t notice that there’s a stairway leading downstairs because it’s behind a wall that we seem to disappear behind when we need to get something. All you’ll see is the masters and instructors demonstrating and the students following along or the students practicing together on their own.</p>

            <p>If you’re one of those people staring through the door thinking, wow that’s pretty cool or wow my kid might like that, try signing up for it yourself. Maybe you’re nervous, or excited, or you’re not really feeling anything at all. You don’t have to do much; just open the door, walk inside, and talk to the guy who’s at the desk (you can call him Master Her if you wanted to know). It might be pretty loud when you walk in, but you’ll get used to it. Ask him if you can do a trial class and now you’re already closer to doing this cool form of self-defense. You walk onto the mat and greet the masters and instructors with a bow and a “hello sir!” You take the trial class with the masters and instructors guiding you through everything a new student needs to learn. Don’t worry, you’re not doing anything too crazy yet. You go home and now you know a little more about taekwondo. Perhaps you even enjoyed it and want to do more, so maybe you keep going back to the point where you now know how to properly kick, how to do simple blocks, how to punch, and how to do the first form. You just learned how to do the basics of taekwondo, and even have a couple of tapes on your belt to prove it. You can now say “I know taekwondo”. Perhaps you’ve attained more than just taekwondo skills–something just for yourself.  I definitely have.</p>

            <p>I never actually really noticed the Professional Taekwondo place. Despite the fact that I’ve passed by it countless times before, all I really saw was the inflatable black belt guy at the front. When I was about to actually start, however, that inflatable guy was gone and all I saw were the people on the inside yelling and kicking in ways that I’d never seen before. I honestly never wanted to start taking taekwondo classes; it was my mom that told me something along the lines of “you have to start doing something–you can’t just sit at home all day!” Out of all the things she could’ve signed me up for, it was taekwondo. I was pretty close to horrified; was I really going to have to take those classes? The ones where everyone was moving and kicking like I could never imagine doing myself? On the day of my first class, before it even started, I was reluctant to even take my shoes and socks off. “Take off your shoes!”, Grandmaster Kim said to me, “socks too.” To me, taking my shoes and socks off in a public area was pretty taboo. I kept thinking, damn, if only my mom never talked to her friend about her kids taking taekwondo classes; I would never be in this situation! I could’ve been playing soccer, maybe even basketball, with proper footwear. Thinking back, it’s funny how that was one of the reasons why I didn’t want to take these taekwondo classes. When I did eventually step onto the mat to start the class, I didn’t want to do anything. I did everything half-assed, maybe even quarter-assed. When we did jumping jacks, I barely lifted my arms. When we were stretching, I barely moved my back. It was one of the instructors on the side that had to coax me to even try. I have to thank him for getting through stubbornness. Eventually, the class ends and huh, that wasn’t that bad. I even got a tape for my horrible effort.  During my next class, I’m guessing it went a lot more smoothly since the only thing I remember was another one of the instructors introducing himself to me because I hadn’t seen him the other day. As time went on, I could see myself actually trying. I was doing normal push-ups and jumping jacks. I was kicking the way that they told me to. I was also, of course, greeting the masters and instructors with a “hello sir!”. Next thing I knew, I had the next belt, and then the next belt, and then the next belt. At this point, I was putting 100% effort into my classes–something I never imagined myself doing a couple of months or years back. Maybe it was the people around me or the masters and instructors that pushed me. Being in the Professional Taekwondo place gives me the motivation that I never thought I had. It has cemented its place as somewhere I had put a lot of time and effort into.</p>

            <p>I wish people knew that this taekwondo place is a place where you can train like in a gym, but instead of lifting weights and running on treadmills, you’re practicing your form or perfecting your kicks while being taught by amazing masters and instructors. At least that’s how I see it. Other students may not be actively trying to practice as hard as they can but want to learn how to do taekwondo in general. Some may just enjoy the community and see it as a place to work out while having fun. A few may not even be there because they want to, but because their parents told them to go. I see the taekwondo place as somewhere where I am constantly trying to do my best when I can, maybe not as much now as before, but I still try to push myself.  No matter how much things seem to change–students may come, students may leave, even instructors and masters may come and leave–the Professional Taekwondo place has never changed for me, although my view of it has, so I will always greet everyone with a “Hello, Sir!”</p>
